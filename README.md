# iTEP Submission Form
A submission form used in our integrated pathway for our teacher credential program at CSUMB.
Students can go to the link we provide them and upload their submission materials using this
form. The form then gets passed to the google script on the backend and checks to see if the student
has submitted files before, if they have their student folder is located and their files are uploaded there.
If they have not submitted before, a new folder is created with the students name and their files are 
put in the folder.
